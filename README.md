## How is the Lightweight VR Headset Different from the average VR Headset?

The components in the average VR Headset are congested and not evenly spaced out. Hence they are heavy and bulky.

The lightweight VR headset aims to distribute the components of the average VR Headset, so that the weight of the components is distributed and does not put stress on a single region of the wearerâ€™s head.

My design takes on the form of a headset that would normally be used for listening to music, but with the advantage of a visor which can be worn over the eyes when in use or pushed back over the band of the headset, when not in use.

The Visor consists of a full length lens for a more immersive experience. The dial to adjust the display is present on the ends of the visor.

The headset itself consists of the earphones and remaining circuitry necessary for the headset.
